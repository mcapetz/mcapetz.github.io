## About
Hello! I am a Computer Science undergraduate student at UCLA. I am interested in applying machine learning for equity and innovations in sustainability.

My experience spans climate research, machine learning, software engineering, and community organizing. Broadly, I care about climate action and social equity. I am particularly interested in machine learning for power and energy systems to make the clean energy transition more equitable. My other research interests include graph machine learning, data-driven agriculture, bioremediation. 

Outside of work, I love being outdoors, whether I’m rock climbing, backpacking, hiking, or swimming. I also enjoy cooking, listening to live jazz, and playing pickleball.
